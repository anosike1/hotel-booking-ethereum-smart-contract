# Hotel-Booking-Ethereum-Smart-Contract [2024]

This is a simple smart contact created via solidity to book a hotel room on the blockchain.

It has features like:
- Automatically changing a room from Vacant to Occupied, upon payment
- Showing you the address of the owner
- Checking the current status of a room
- Changing the status of a room (to either OCCUPIED or VACANT)... This is if you are the OWNER.

**INSTRUCTIONS:**

- Open https://remix.ethereum.org/ , a browser-based IDE that helps us develop smart contracts without using any terminal or text editor.
- Paste the smart contract source code in the IDE and compile the smart contract to generate byte code of your source code.
- After successful compilation, you can deploy the smart contract to a virtual blockchain of your choice that is offered by the IDE - in this case, you can select JavascriptVM to deploy.
- After deploying, you are done with building your first smart contract!!
- Check deployed contracts on the left panel of your IDE and keep performing booking operations which will be recorded as transactions in the blockchain.
